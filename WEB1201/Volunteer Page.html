                        It has been a wonderful experience working with the Climat Foundation crew. Due to my volunteer 
                        role, I learned a lot of new things from the staff, especially resource management, which will 
                        help me in my future management career. I will recommend the Climate Foundation Volunteer Program 
                        to friends and attend many more volunteer events they host in the future.

                        As a fresh graduate, I was initially concerned that my inexperience would cause trouble for the 
                        rebuilding team. However, the members there were really helpful and always patiently explained 
                        construction methods that I was unfamiliar with. If you are a junior civil engineer looking to 
                        contribute to your community, the Climat Foundation is the best choice.

                        there, I can focus on helping the injured without worrying about other factors because the Climat 
                        Foundation will manage them well. I will join them again in the future.

                                according to our guidelines, certain roles may require parental consent to ensure a positive

                                while volunteering, you can make a complaint to our advisors. If you do not like your current role, 
                                you can contact our advisors and request to switch your volunteer role.</div>
